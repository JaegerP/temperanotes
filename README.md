![Logo](https://github.com/davidedelvento/temperanotes/blob/master/logo.png)

Temperanotes is command line Musical Temperament Editor useful to transform temperament descriptions such as the ones found on wikipedia (e.g. [Werckmeister temperament II]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werckmeister_temperament#Werckmeister_II_.28IV.29:_another_temperament_included_in_the_Orgelprobe.2C_divided_up_through_1.2F3_comma)) into practically usable formats, such as the input format for [timidity](http://timidity.sourceforge.net/) described [here](http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/12566/what-file-format-does-timiditys-z-or-freq-table-option-require). 

# Details
At the moment I'm focusing on Well Temperaments from the late 1600s to the early 1700s and on timidity only, but I may expand to other eras and software later (and pull request will always be welcome)

# Name and Logo
Temperanotes name is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of [temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament) and [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note).
The logo is an Italian [tongue in cheek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek) since in Italian *temperare* (the act of creating a temperament) means more commonly sharpening a pencil.
